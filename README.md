# MEAN Stack starter application

## Introduction
This is the basic scaffold for the developers who find it quite annoying to initiate a project on [node.js] with [AngularJS] and MongoDB (document-oriented noSQL database). This gives the user to focus on development rather to waste time on scaffolding.

## Why is the need?
With the new technologies coming up every day, MEAN Stack has been pretty close to developer's heart. While new developers initiate their learning with NodeJS, Anugular, MongoDB and Express, they generally get pretty much stuck with messy code and digress from the simple path, getting tangled in the complications of environment-setup.

This is the initiative I took, by making a basic lightweight scaffold to make them focus on development and to learn the real technology!
