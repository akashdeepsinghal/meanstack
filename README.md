# MEAN Stack starter application

## Introduction
This is the basic scaffold for the developers who find it quite annoying to initiate a project on [node.js] with [AngularJS] and MongoDB (document-oriented noSQL database). This gives the user to focus on development rather to waste time on scaffolding.

## Installation
1. Download the repository
2. Install npm modules: `npm install`
3. Install bower dependencies `bower install`
4. Start up the server: `node app`
5. View in browser at http://localhost:1210

## Features
1. Options for user Signup / Login.
2. oAuth integration using [passport]
3. Pre-Built CRUD operations APIs
4. No junk libraries

Use this starter kit to build any MEAN stack application you like. Developers are invited to contribute.
